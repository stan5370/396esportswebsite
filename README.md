### Vercel Hosting
To host on Vercel, all we did was link the Github repository that contained all of the project files. In addition to this, we set the root of the Vercel app to src/ such that the index.html file would load properly.

This allowed us to have free hosting at the vercel.app domain:
https://396esportswebsite.vercel.app/

Demo video: https://youtube.com/live/VEHyOuCrhEI?feature=share

Changes since video creation:
  - added fake sponsors for demonstration purposes (no interactions)
  - added team + roster listings to the about page (no interactions)
  - added leadership team to about page (no interactions)
  - fixed a tiny path name error to clear up a sneaky console error (no end-user difference)

### Self-hosting

If you would like to host this site on your own, simply use Github pages or some other basic webserver (Node.js, etc.) to host all of the contents in the ./src folder.
